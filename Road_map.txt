Habitica Automation & Power BI Roadmap

1. **Prototype Stage**

   * Set up Habitica account and create habits, dailies, todos.
   * Get API credentials (User ID & API Token).
   * Write Python script to fetch data from Habitica API.
   * Save data to CSV.
   * Connect CSV to Power BI and build basic visualizations (completion rates, streaks, trends).

2. **Automation Stage**

   * Schedule Python script (Windows Task Scheduler / cron) to run daily.
   * Store fetched data in a lightweight database (SQLite or SQL Server Express).
   * Clean and transform data automatically using Python or Power Query.
   * Update Power BI dashboard automatically from database.

3. **Enhancement Stage**

   * Add more habit metrics (daily/weekly summaries, streak length, habit difficulty).
   * Improve dashboard design (colors, filters, interactive charts).
   * Integrate multiple sources (fitness apps, study trackers) for multi-habit analytics.

4. **Deployment Stage**

   * Prepare final dashboard for sharing/viewing.
   * Ensure automation runs without manual intervention.
   * Document setup instructions and API workflow for future reference.

5. **Future Expansion**

   * Add predictive analytics (habit streak predictions, completion trends).
   * Add reminders/notifications via email or messaging apps.
   * Open-source project on GitHub with README, roadmap, and example dashboard screenshots.
